     - Sea water pump
     - | Replaced old Ancor sea pump with W408080. 
       | Docs say ancor pump was serviced in 2016,
       | but quality of work was poor.
   * - July 2023
     - Raw water impeller
     - Impeller was included in the new housing W48080
   * - August 2023
     - Transmission fluid
     - Used Pennzoil Dexron II equivalent ATF fluid
   * - August 2023
     - V-drive oil
     - | Used Delo 400 SAE 30 weight. 
       | Old oil was dark, with some very 
       | fine metal shavings on drain plug.
   * - August 2023
     - Fresh water pump
     - | In July 2023, Gartside noticed leak (not active)
       | from weep hole in the belt-driveb. You can't 
       | water pump. You can't service the pump, so I replaced 
       | with a brand new one. Uses paper gasket and I added
       | loctite 515 to add some extra sealing capability.
       | I also change out the old bypass hose, but it was challenging 
       | since new water pump had larger nipple. I comprimised 
       | and am using a soft-walled tube pressed only the larger nipple.
